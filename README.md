Data Science for Smart Environments

The individual portofolio notebook was contains three sections: introduction, readme and reflection
Readme section was divided into three sections presenting each type of goals : 
- data (wrangling)
- Information (combining, analysis, data quality, visualization)
- knowledge (social and ethical aspects)
  
Results of my works are being used for group project except for story map.

Note: It will be easier if you rerun my notebook in Google Colaboratory.

The folder "Raw Data" contains some of the original data used in the notebooks.
